# Introduction to AI
## Foundations of generative AI

- **Cognitive task:**
	- Any mental activity, such as thinking, understanding, learning, and remembering.

- **Artificial intelligence (AI):**
	- Computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence.

- **AI tool:**
	- AI-powered software that can automate or assist users with a variety of tasks.

- **Machine learning (ML):**
	- A subset of AI focused on developing computer programs that can analyze data to make decisions or predictions.

- **Training set:**
	- A collection of data used to teach AI.

- **How a generative AI tool works with natural language:**
	- Provide data
	- Data in processed
	- Output is generated.

## A Guide to AI and ML

#### Overview

- AI and ML are transforming the future of work.
- Machine Learning is a subset of AI.
- Understanding AI and ML helps contribute to AI-driven projects or lead AI initiatives.

### AI Development Techniques

#### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- **Definition**: Computer programs that perform cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence.
- **Techniques**:
    - **Rule-Based Techniques**: Follow predefined rules to make decisions.
        - Example: A spam filter blocking emails with specific keywords.
    - **Machine Learning Techniques**: Analyze and learn from data patterns to make decisions.
        - Example: A spam filter that adapts based on user input, flagging potential spam for review.

#### Use Cases

- **Rule-Based Techniques**: Best for tasks requiring rigidity.
    - Example: Blocking obvious spam messages.
- **ML Techniques**: Best for tasks needing flexibility and adaptability.
    - Example: Recognizing trusted senders despite typos.

### Approaches to Training ML Programs

#### Supervised Learning

- **Definition**: Learning from a labeled training set with context and meaning.
- **Example**: An email spam filter trained on emails labeled "spam" or "not spam."

#### Unsupervised Learning

- **Definition**: Learning from an unlabeled training set to find patterns in data.
- **Example**: Analyzing unsorted emails to identify topics or keywords.

#### Reinforcement Learning

- **Definition**: Learning through trial and error, receiving rewards for optimal actions.
- **Example**: Conversational AI tools improving responses based on user feedback.

### Generative AI

### Definition

- AI that can create new content like text, images, or other media.

#### Techniques

- Combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

#### Examples

- **Conversational AI Tools**:
    - **Supervised Learning**: Provides foundational dialogue data.
    - **Unsupervised Learning**: Helps interpret language nuances.
    - **Reinforcement Learning**: Improves responses based on feedback.

#### Benefits

- **Greater Efficiency**: Automates or augments routine tasks.
- **Personalized Experiences**: Tailors interactions to individual preferences.
- **Better Decisions**: Analyzes large datasets for valuable insights.

## Use AI as a collaborative tool

- **AI augmentation:**
	- The process of using AI to improve a work product, whether by making it easier to do or higher in quality.

- **AI automation:**
	- The process of using AI to accomplish tasks without any action on the user's part.
