# Maximize Productivity With AI Tools
## AI Models and the Training Process
### Overview

- Understanding AI models and the training process helps in discussing AI tools accurately and confidently.
- AI models are developed through an iterative process to ensure reliability in AI tools.

### AI Tools and AI Models
#### Definitions

- **AI Tool**: AI-powered software that automates or assists with various tasks.
- **AI Model**: A computer program trained on data to recognize patterns and perform specific tasks.

#### Metaphor: Car and Engine

- **The Car (AI Tool)**:
    - Gets you to a "destination" (completed task or output).
    - Designed with features and controls for a user-friendly experience.
- **The Engine (AI Model)**:
    - Underlying component that makes the "car" run.
    - Processes user input and enables the functionality of the tool.

#### AI Tools and Models

- AI tools can use multiple AI models for more flexibility and to perform a wider range of tasks.

### The Process of Training AI Models
#### Typical Steps

1. **Define the Problem**
    - Example: Predicting rain to help people stay dry.
    - Consider AI’s capabilities and limitations.

2. **Collect Relevant Data**
    - Gather historical data on rain and non-rain days over the past 50 years.

3. **Prepare the Data**
    - Label important features (e.g., temperature, humidity, air pressure).
    - Separate data into a _training set_ and a _validation set_.

4. **Train the Model**
    - Apply ML programs to recognize patterns indicating the likelihood of rainfall.

5. **Evaluate the Model**
    - Use the validation set to assess accuracy and reliability.
    - Address potential issues such as insufficient or biased data.

6. **Deploy the Model**
    - Deploy in an AI tool once satisfied with performance.
    - Example: Helping people stay dry on their way to work.

#### Iterative Process

- Steps are repeated as necessary to create the best model possible.
- Continuous monitoring and feedback collection after deployment.
- Iterative refinement ensures models remain precise and versatile.

#### Importance

- Understanding model development helps in making informed decisions about using AI tools effectively.

## Leverage the human-in-the-loop approach to AI

- **Human-in-the-loop approach:**
	- A combination of machine and human intelligence to train, use, verify, and refine AI models.

- **Responsible AI:**
	- The principle of developing and using AI ethically, with the intent of benefitting people and society white avoiding harm.

- **Knowledge cutoff:**
	- The concept that an AI model is trained at a specific point in time, so it doesn't have any knowledge of events or information after that date.

- Hallucinations:
	- AI outputs that are not true.

## Determine if generative AI is right for the task

- **Asses whether to apply generative AI to a task:**
	- is the task generative?
	- Can the task be iterated on a achieve the best outcome?
	- Are there resources that provide adequate human oversight?
